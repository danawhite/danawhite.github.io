                    <br>
                    <br>The following schedule is based on general research and analysis of your project. The goals that you want to achieve with the implementation of the project can be broken down to the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create an community of users who suffer from one or more of a predetermined list of diseases/conditions</li>
                        <li>Create an network of Good Samaritans who are willing to help patients who need some form of care/assistance before first responders arrive on the scene. </li>
                        <li>Maximum return on investment</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As an agency with a focus on return on investment, we are dedicated to creating a robust, highly scalable application that will allow you to focus on
                    securing clients  and building a community with the confidence that users will have a consistent, immersive experience each time they visit BeKon.
                    <p>To achieve the above objectives, we divide the upcoming project into 5 sections:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Planning & Requirements Analysis</li>

            <p class="proposal-content">Our task will be to strengthen your brand online by implementing a customized development strategy with proven methods and results. Our goal is to position BeKon as the leading option amongst other applications that provide a similar service.</p>
            <p>The focus is always the communication of values and innovation.</p>
            <p>We achieve this through the following points:</p>
            <ul class="item-content">
                <li>Providing a dynamic user experience for the end user</li>
                <li>Implementation of cutting-edge features and trends</li>
                <li>Maintaining a consistent user experience across multiple screens</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <!--<p>Customers should be satisfied after every BeKon session. The point is to document the customer experience, communicate online through social media, and to spread the message virally. Potential new customers will immediately understand what is actually mediated only by a session on site. This will help your brand to be known and trusted to drive traffic to your site and to sustainably increase sales.</p>-->
            <p>The focus of the above strategies is on the quality, the feel and the impact of your product to communicate online in such a way that visitors and customers talk about your brand online and offline, thus growing the brand virally.</p>

                    <p>The elements created during the design stage are largely derived from the approved requirements that we create during the planning phase. For each requirement, one or more design elements will be produced.</p>
                    <p>At the end of this phase (typically 1-2 weeks), our deliverable will be a prototype that will accurately depict the functionality, flow and overall structure that should be expected when interacting with the real application.

                    <p>In this phase, we bring your idea and vision to life. We create your online presence based on
                        the findings gained in the previous sections as well as the design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During this phase, we perform the actual coding. We will employ a test-driven development process
                        to ensure the validity of the code that we write as we write it as opposed to solely relying on
                        testing afterwards. This process will severely decrease the potential for bugs that would need to
                        be addressed post-deployment.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition, we will develop a number of cloud-hosted services that will allow seamless communication
                        between the front-end client and the backend infrastructure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we will style the applications such that a consistency of design is maintained across each platform.
                        This is typically the longest phase of the application development process.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our objective is to create a solid foundation by building an application that is highly scalable once
                        demand increases and new features are added. Also, the code base will be well-documented for the purpose
                        of optimal maintainability.

                        Smartphone users have grown to expect certain functionality when viewing content on their devices. In order to remain competitive,
                        it is imperative that these items are captured while pushing the envelope by incorporating cutting-edge features that are made
                        available to developers for implementation in applications.

                    <p>
                        We will leverage <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank">React Native</a>,
                        an immensely popular JavaScript framework, and Swift, a programming language designed to create native applications for Apple iPhone, Watch, Apple TV and Macs.
                        React Native will allow us to build one application that will run on <a href="#">iOS</a>
                        and <a href="#">Android</a> platforms, respectively. As previously stated, it is
                        imperative that we maintain integrity across platforms in terms of design. Swift will provide the hooks needed to
                        access native APIs such as HealthKit, WatchKit and Touch ID.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the application will be developed in such a way that it we will be able to deploy to Android and Apple devices, respectively,
                        from one code base, I recommend that we focus intitially on developing for Apple devices (iPhone and Watch). Apple provides APIs (HealthKit and CareKit, among others)
                        that will allow the application to work with user's shared health data.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our development schedule will be as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>iPhone</li>

            <p>In addition, we will require a $1000 monthly retainer to maintain the existing codebase. Some examples of occurrences that would warrant maintenance include the following:</p>
